                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The parking meter is something I often see on the side of the road but never 
                    use. Once I was walking along and a tourist asked me how to use a meter, unfortunately, 
                    I haven't used one either. </p>
                    <p>Later I'm curious about how it works and tried by myself. 
                    I found the user interaction was not very sensitive, and the operation is not sequence 
                    so that take me some time. Therefore I started my exploration.
                </p>

                <h3>Annotated sketch of interface</h3>
                <p>Here is my designed interface with the description, that is what I think should be a better interface.</p>
                <div class="container"><img class="hw" src="src/scrach.jpg"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="text text3">
                <h3>Empathy maps</h3>
                <p>Based on the interview, Here is the empathy map designed for the interface</p>

                <h5>John:</h5>
                <div class="container"><img class="hw" src="src/John.jpg"></div>

                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <p>Based on Sarah, I created this storyboard to demonstrate the experience of user with parking meter interface.</p>
                <div class="container"><img class="hw" src="src/storyboard.jpg" height="1000px"></div>
