                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The parking meter is something I often see on the side of the road but never 
                    use. Once I was walking along and a tourist asked me how to use a meter, unfortunately, 
                    I haven't used one either. </p>
                    <p>Later I'm curious about how it works and tried by myself. 
                    I found the user interaction was not very sensitive, and the operation is not sequence 
                    so that take me some time. Therefore I started my exploration.
                </p>

                <h3>Interview for users</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have you tried looking for free parking nearby?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basically, try to find a free location.</li>
                            <li>Running out of time or too far so had to stop at the paid area.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Do you prefer to use cards or coins?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Depends on personal habits, but cards may be more convenient nowadays</li>
                            <li>But the card has limitations in some machines (minimum spend, only accept credit cards, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Choose coins if capable and enough.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>When was the last time you used a parking meter?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basically, not very frequent, occasionally used.</li>
                            <li>One elder guy is using it for the first time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>If this is your first time using a parking meter, how would you like it to be more efficient?
                        <ul>
                            <li>hope the font on the electronic screen can be clearer.</li>
                            <li>list the process steps to be simpler, after all, in a hurry.</li>
                            <li>Buttons work well!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Annotated sketch of interface</h3>
                <p>Here is my designed interface with the description, that is what I think should be a better interface.</p>

                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <p>Based on Sarah, I created this storyboard to demonstrate the experience of user with parking meter interface.</p>
